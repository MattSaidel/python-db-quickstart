Python database quickstart
--------------------------

You will need a dbconfig.py file saved in the datasource folder, and the file should look like this:

```python
postgres_connection = {
	'username': 'postgres',
	'password': 'NotMyRealPassword',
	'host': 'matthewsaidel.com'
}
```

You have to create this yourself, because obviously I'm not going to put the passwords on GitHub.
